We create an algorithm to generate new content via existing text using a mixture model consisting of a weighted prediction structure and several predictive components. Weights for a given category of text can either be obtained from visual examination of output, or derived via an iterative training process based on the Metropolis algorithm. Compared to single-model methods of text prediction, the mixture model achieves comparable predictive results while being computationally cheaper and more flexible in specifications.
